`IngressGateway` configures a workload to act as a gateway for
traffic entering the mesh. The ingress gateway also provides basic
API gateway functionalities such as JWT token validation, rate
limiting, and request authorization. Gateways in privileged
workspaces can route to services outside the workspace while those
in unprivileged workspaces can only route to services inside the
workspace.

The following example declares an ingress gateway running on pods
with `app: gateway` labels in the `ns1` namespace. The gateway
exposes a host `bookinfo.com` on https port 8443. TLS is terminated
using the certificates in the Kubernetes secret
`bookinfo-certs`. Clients are authenticated using JWT tokens, whose
keys are obtained from the OIDC provider `www.googleapis.com`. The
request is then authorized by an the user's authorization engine
hosted at `https://internal.example.com` before being forwarded to
the `productpage` service in the backend.

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.tsb.io/v1
kind: IngressGateway
metadata:
  name: ingress-bookinfo
  group: g1
  workspace: w1
  tenant: mycompany
spec:
  workloadSelector:
    namespace: ns1
    labels:
      app: gateway
  http:
    - hostname: bookinfo.com
      tls:
        mode: SIMPLE
        secretName: bookinfo-certs
      authentication:
        jwt:
          issuer: https:www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs
          audience: bookinfo
      authorization:
        external:
          uri: https:company.com/authz
          includeRequestHeaders:
            - Authorization # forwards the header to the authorization service.
      routing:
        rules:
          - route:
              host: ns1/productpage.ns1.svc.cluster.local
```

If the `productpage.ns1` service on Kubernetes has a `ServiceRoute`
with multiple subsets and weights, the traffic will be split across
the subsets accordingly.

TODO(rshriram): Add lot more examples in the gateway section.
